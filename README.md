## General Introduction

Electric Power Supply System (EPSS) is the backbone of modern
societies. Its serviceability is significant to the security and sustainability
of communities being much more sophisticated and integrated than
before. Unfortunately, as exemplified by many incidences during the
recent history, the EPSSs were shown to be vulnerable under natural
hazards as well as the random failures. Consequently, serious economic
and societal losses of the community would be aroused. More importantly,
due to the intrinsic characteristics of EPSS, a seemingly not serious local
damage can propagate and lead to a phenomenal global failure of the
system and even other connected infrastructure systems.
Against this backdrop, the adaptive mitigation strategy for the
potential cascade within the damaged EPSS will firstly be investigated in
this project. Furthermore, the recovery process of the corresponding
EPSS will then be consider and modeled.


## The Model

For the ongoing project, the Agent-Based Modeling approach is powerful
and will be employed to fulfill our goals.
Specifically, the predefined agents include the set of different
technical components such as the generation substation as well as the
distribution substations within EPSS, and the non-technical component
like operators or emergency administrators.
The interaction rules between the non-technical agent and different
technical agents shall also be predefined in a rational way.

## Fundamental Questions

-How does the Electric Power System behave after a Natural Disaster?
-What is the resilience of the Electric Power System?
-How does the failure in the system propagates through time?


## Expected Results

Accordingly, the proposed framework will be applied on the
example network and the results will be examined and discussed finally.
